# Persistence Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Import Issue
**Problem**: The `/pages/api/shifts/[id].js` endpoint was importing from `@vercel/postgres` instead of the custom `vercel-db.js` wrapper.
**Fix**: Changed import to use the local wrapper that properly handles Neon database connections.

### 2. Shift Deletion Not Working
**Problem**: The API client was calling the wrong endpoint for shift deletion.
**Fix**: Updated the API client to use the correct query parameter format: `/shifts?shiftId=${id}`

### 3. SQL Query Method Error
**Problem**: The Neon database client doesn't support `sql.query()` method.
**Fix**: Updated to use the proper template literal syntax for SQL queries.

### 4. Better Error Handling
**Problem**: Database operations were failing silently.
**Fix**: Added proper error handling and user notifications when operations fail.

## How to Test Persistence

1. **Test the database connection**:
   - Navigate to your app and log in
   - Open developer console (F12)
   - Try creating a new shift or staff member
   - Check if data persists after page refresh

2. **Use the test endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test-persistence-fix
   ```

3. **Common operations to verify**:
   - Add new staff member → Refresh → Staff should persist
   - Create shifts → Refresh → Shifts should persist
   - Delete a shift → Refresh → Shift should be gone
   - Edit staff details → Refresh → Changes should persist

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Vercel deployment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon database connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token generation

## If Issues Persist

1. Check Vercel logs for database connection errors
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is correctly set
3. Test the `/api/test-persistence-fix` endpoint for detailed diagnostics
4. Check browser console for API errors

## Summary of Changes

- Fixed database import in `/pages/api/shifts/[id].js`
- Updated API client shift deletion endpoint
- Fixed SQL query syntax for Neon compatibility
- Added error notifications for failed database operations
- Improved error handling in shift generation
