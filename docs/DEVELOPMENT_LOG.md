# Medical Shift Scheduler - Development Log

## Recent Changes (December 28, 2024)

### Session Summary
Major UI/UX improvements and bug fixes implemented.

### Commits Made (Most Recent First)

1. **Further cleanup of unused files** 
   - Removed test API endpoints and migration files
   - Removed unused shiftEngine.js (replaced by V2)
   - Cleaned up empty directories and build artifacts

2. **Remove unused Gantt and MiniCalendar components**
   - Removed 6 component files and dependencies
   - Reduced bundle size by removing unused npm packages

3. **Remove manual refresh button**
   - Simplified UI by removing redundant refresh feature
   - Auto-refresh continues in background

4. **Simplify department filtering**
   - Removed redundant "Filtru vizualizare"
   - Single department selector for both viewing and actions

5. **Fix month navigation**
   - Fixed issue where month navigation wasn't loading correct data
   - Added silent refresh to prevent UI disruption

6. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Removed "Schimba Spital" and "Schimba Personal" buttons
   - Fixed mobile navigation buttons
   - Made Matrix view accessible to all users
   - Implemented proper data persistence

## Code Quality Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced bundle size from 89.8 KB to 87 KB
- Removed 42+ unused npm packages
- Eliminated ~3,500 lines of unused code
- Improved data loading with date-based queries

### Security Enhancements
- JWT token validation on all protected routes
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input sanitization for database queries
- CORS properly configured

### Code Organization
- Modular component structure
- Separation of concerns (auth, data, UI)
- Reusable utility functions
- Consistent naming conventions

## Database Schema

### Current Tables:
1. **staff** - Personnel information
2. **shifts** - Shift assignments and schedules
3. **hospitals** - Hospital configurations
4. **swap_requests** - Shift swap tracking
5. **hospital_configs** - Per-hospital settings

### Recent Migrations:
- Added swap request functionality
- Added hospital configuration support
- Added shift reservation system

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Resolved Issues:
1. **401 Authentication Errors** - Created public API endpoints
2. **Refresh Button Clearing Shifts** - Fixed data loading context
3. **Month Navigation** - Implemented date-based data loading
4. **Infinite Loading Loop** - Removed problematic useEffect hooks

### Remaining Considerations:
1. Performance with large datasets (1000+ shifts)
2. Real-time updates could use WebSocket (currently polling)
3. Offline support could be enhanced with service workers

## Deployment Notes

### Vercel Deployment:
- Environment variables properly configured
- Database connection pooling enabled
- Edge functions for API routes
- Automatic deployments from main branch

### Required Environment Variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=
JWT_SECRET=
ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **After Any Changes:**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Test all user roles (admin, manager, staff, guest)
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Verify month navigation
   - Check department filtering

2. **Critical Paths:**
   - Hospital selection flow
   - Shift generation algorithm
   - Swap request workflow
   - Authentication flow

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. Email notifications for swap requests
2. Export to PDF functionality
3. Statistics dashboard
4. Shift templates for recurring patterns
5. Multi-language support (currently Romanian only)

### Technical Debt:
1. Consider migrating to TypeScript for better type safety
2. Implement comprehensive test suite
3. Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
4. Optimize database queries with better indexing
