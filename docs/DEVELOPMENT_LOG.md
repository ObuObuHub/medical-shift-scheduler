# Medical Shift Scheduler - Development Log

## Recent Changes (January 6, 2025)

### Simplified Shift Reservation System

Implemented a much simpler and more intuitive shift reservation system:

1. **Unified Shift Creation Interface**
   - Created `ShiftTypeSelector` component - a simple modal for selecting shift types
   - Staff, managers, and admins now use the same simple interface
   - Clicking on empty days shows available shift types based on hospital configuration

2. **Simplified Staff Reservations**
   - Staff can now reserve shifts by clicking on any empty day (just like managers)
   - System automatically creates and reserves the shift in one action
   - Removed confusing dual behavior (open shift vs empty day)
   - Monthly limit clearly displayed: 2 shifts or 48 hours total

3. **Reservation Counter**
   - Added `ReservationCounter` component showing current month's reservations
   - Visual indicator: "1/2 ture" and "24/48 ore"
   - Warning when limit is reached
   - Only shown to staff (managers/admins have no limits)

4. **Generator Improvements**
   - Updated shift generator to respect ALL reserved shifts
   - Previously only respected shifts matching expected types
   - Now preserves any shift created by staff regardless of type
   - Prevents automatic schedule generation from overriding staff preferences

5. **Technical Changes**
   - Simplified `handleCellClick` logic across all dashboards
   - Removed complex `AddShiftModal` usage for simple shift creation
   - Consistent experience across Calendar and Matrix views
   - Build size: 47.9 KB (First Load: 128 KB)

This makes the system work exactly as requested: staff can simply select their preferred 2 shifts per month using the same mechanism as managers, and the automatic generator respects these choices.

### Phase 1 Implementation - Integration Plan (Earlier Today)

Major enhancements to improve feature integration and user experience:

1. **Unified Department Context**
   - Added shared `selectedDepartment` state to DataContext with localStorage persistence
   - Created `DepartmentIndicator` component for consistent department selection across all dashboards
   - Updated MatrixView to use the shared department context instead of local state

2. **Enhanced Notification System**
   - Created database migration for notifications table with support for multiple notification types
   - Implemented comprehensive notification API endpoints (CRUD operations, preferences, mark all as read)
   - Built `NotificationCenter` component with:
     - Real-time notification display with unread count badge
     - Notification preferences management
     - Auto-polling every 30 seconds for new notifications
     - Optimistic UI updates for marking as read/deleting
   - Integrated NotificationCenter into all dashboards (Admin, Manager, Staff)
   - Enhanced DataContext's `addNotification` to support persistent notifications in database

3. **Optimistic UI Updates with Rollback**
   - Implemented optimistic updates for shift operations:
     - `reserveShift`: Immediate UI update with rollback on API failure
     - `cancelReservation`: Instant feedback with error recovery
     - `deleteShift`: Quick removal with restoration on error
   - All updates store previous state for seamless rollback on failures
   - Improved perceived performance and user experience

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Added `CheckCheck` icon to Icons collection
   - Enhanced error handling with proper rollback mechanisms
   - Improved API client with notification-related methods
   - Build size: 46.9 KB (First Load: 127 KB)

## Recent Changes (December 28, 2024)

### Session Summary
Major UI/UX improvements and bug fixes implemented.

### Commits Made (Most Recent First)

1. **Further cleanup of unused files** 
   - Removed test API endpoints and migration files
   - Removed unused shiftEngine.js (replaced by V2)
   - Cleaned up empty directories and build artifacts

2. **Remove unused Gantt and MiniCalendar components**
   - Removed 6 component files and dependencies
   - Reduced bundle size by removing unused npm packages

3. **Remove manual refresh button**
   - Simplified UI by removing redundant refresh feature
   - Auto-refresh continues in background

4. **Simplify department filtering**
   - Removed redundant "Filtru vizualizare"
   - Single department selector for both viewing and actions

5. **Fix month navigation**
   - Fixed issue where month navigation wasn't loading correct data
   - Added silent refresh to prevent UI disruption

6. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Removed "Schimba Spital" and "Schimba Personal" buttons
   - Fixed mobile navigation buttons
   - Made Matrix view accessible to all users
   - Implemented proper data persistence

## Code Quality Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced bundle size from 89.8 KB to 87 KB
- Removed 42+ unused npm packages
- Eliminated ~3,500 lines of unused code
- Improved data loading with date-based queries

### Security Enhancements
- JWT token validation on all protected routes
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input sanitization for database queries
- CORS properly configured

### Code Organization
- Modular component structure
- Separation of concerns (auth, data, UI)
- Reusable utility functions
- Consistent naming conventions

## Database Schema

### Current Tables:
1. **staff** - Personnel information
2. **shifts** - Shift assignments and schedules
3. **hospitals** - Hospital configurations
4. **swap_requests** - Shift swap tracking
5. **hospital_configs** - Per-hospital settings

### Recent Migrations:
- Added swap request functionality
- Added hospital configuration support
- Added shift reservation system

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Resolved Issues:
1. **401 Authentication Errors** - Created public API endpoints
2. **Refresh Button Clearing Shifts** - Fixed data loading context
3. **Month Navigation** - Implemented date-based data loading
4. **Infinite Loading Loop** - Removed problematic useEffect hooks

### Remaining Considerations:
1. Performance with large datasets (1000+ shifts)
2. Real-time updates could use WebSocket (currently polling)
3. Offline support could be enhanced with service workers

## Deployment Notes

### Vercel Deployment:
- Environment variables properly configured
- Database connection pooling enabled
- Edge functions for API routes
- Automatic deployments from main branch

### Required Environment Variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=
JWT_SECRET=
ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **After Any Changes:**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Test all user roles (admin, manager, staff, guest)
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Verify month navigation
   - Check department filtering

2. **Critical Paths:**
   - Hospital selection flow
   - Shift generation algorithm
   - Swap request workflow
   - Authentication flow

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. Email notifications for swap requests
2. Export to PDF functionality
3. Statistics dashboard
4. Shift templates for recurring patterns
5. Multi-language support (currently Romanian only)

### Technical Debt:
1. Consider migrating to TypeScript for better type safety
2. Implement comprehensive test suite
3. Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
4. Optimize database queries with better indexing
